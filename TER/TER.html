                        File Manipulation :
                        <br>


                        To create a file in Linux, you can use the "touch" command followed by the filename. For
                        example, to create a file called "example.txt", you would type "touch example.txt" in the
                        terminal.

                        To remove a file, you can use the "rm" command followed by the filename. For example, to remove
                        the "example.txt" file, you would type "rm example.txt".

                        To rename a file, you can use the "mv" command followed by the current filename and the new
                        filename. For example, to rename the "example.txt" file to "newfile.txt", you would type "mv
                        example.txt newfile.txt".

                        To copy a file, you can use the "cp" command followed by the source filename and the destination
                        filename. For example, to copy the "example.txt" file to a directory called "mydir", you would
                        type "cp example.txt mydir".

                        To move a file, you can use the "mv" command followed by the source filename and the destination
                        directory. For example, to move the "example.txt" file to a directory called "mydir", you would
                        type "mv example.txt mydir".
