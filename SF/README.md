Question: What is the Requests library in Python, and how can I use it to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?

Answer: The Requests library in Python is a popular tool that simplifies sending HTTP requests and interacting with APIs. I can use it by importing the library and calling the requests.get() method. This method takes a URL as an argument and returns a response object containing the details of the HTTP response. Here's an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library:

```
import requests

response = requests.get('url')
print(response.status-code)
print(response.json())

```
