## he random module in Python can be used to generate random numbers or make selections from a list. Some common functions available within the module include randint(), randrange(), choice(), shuffle(), and sample(). randint() generates random integers within a range, randrange() generates random integers within a range with a step value, choice() returns a randomly selected element from a sequence, shuffle() shuffles a sequence randomly, and sample() returns a new list containing unique elements randomly selected from the original list123.

## Risk analysis is the process of identifying potential risks that could impact the success of a software project and categorizing them as risks. The key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project include defining the project’s scope, identifying potential risks that could impact the project’s success, assessing their impact, prioritizing risks, implementing mitigation strategies, and monitoring and making revisions4.

## Test coverage is a metric that specifies the quantity and quality of testing performed. It measures what is tested and how much code, platforms, and different user scenarios are checked. It’s an important metric in software testing in terms of effectiveness and quality5.

## Big O notation is used to describe the performance of an algorithm. It describes how quickly the runtime grows relative to the input size as the input size becomes arbitrarily large. An example of an everyday task that demonstrates O(n) time complexity is finding an item in an unsorted list
