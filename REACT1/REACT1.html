            The concept of graphs encompasses a rich array of ideas in computer science and mathematics. A graph is a powerful non-linear data structure that consists of vertices (also known as nodes) and edges, which connect these vertices. This interconnected nature makes graphs an essential tool for modeling and solving various problems.

Key Terminology:

Vertex: A fundamental element representing a data object, possibly linked to other vertices.
Edge: A conduit connecting two vertices, illustrating a relationship or interaction.
Neighbor: Refers to adjacent nodes, connected by an edge.
Degree: Denotes the count of edges attached to a specific vertex.
Graph Types:

Undirected Graph: Edges have no direction, indicating a symmetric relationship.
Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges possess direction, signifying a one-way connection.
Graph Connectivity:

Complete Graph: Every node links to every other node, forming a dense network.
Connected Graph: All vertices are accessible through edges, forming a continuous structure.
Disconnected Graph: Some nodes lack connections, resulting in isolated components.
Graph Cycles:

Acyclic Graph: No closed loops or cycles, making traversal straightforward.
Cyclic Graph: Contains cycles or loops, necessitating careful traversal to avoid infinite loops.
Graph Representation:

Adjacency Matrix: A 2D array depicting connections between vertices. Symmetry is observed in undirected graphs, while directed graphs lack this symmetry.
Adjacency List: A collection of linked lists or arrays cataloging neighboring vertices, offering efficient representation for sparse graphs.
Weighted Graphs:

Weighted edges introduce numerical values, representing attributes like distance, cost, or preference.
Graph Traversals:

Breadth First Traversal: Explore nodes level by level using a queue, ideal for finding shortest paths.
Depth First Traversal: Traverse as deeply as possible along a branch before backtracking, typically using a stack. Useful for exploring paths exhaustively.
Real-World Applications:

Graphs find applications in diverse areas, such as:
GPS and Mapping: Finding optimal routes and directions.
Social Networks: Modeling relationships and interactions between users.
Airline Traffic: Analyzing flight routes and connections.
Product Recommendations: Offering personalized suggestions, as seen on platforms like Netflix.
