# Django Models

Purpose: Django models are the basic building blocks of a Django application. They represent the data that your application will store in the database.
Basic Structure: A Django model is a Python class that inherits from the django.db.models.Model class. The Model class provides a number of methods and properties for interacting with the database, such as save(), delete(), and get().
Creating and Managing Database Schema: Django models make it easy to create and manage the database schema for your application. When you create a new model, Django will automatically create the corresponding database tables. You can also use models to modify the database schema by adding, deleting, or renaming tables.
Django Admin Interface

Features and Functionality: The Django Admin interface is a web-based interface for managing Django models. It provides a user-friendly way to add, edit, and delete model instances. The Admin interface also includes a number of features for managing permissions and user roles.
Customization: The Django Admin interface can be customized to suit the specific needs of a project. You can change the layout of the interface, add new features, and even create your own custom admin views.
Django Application Workflow

The key components of a Django application are:

Models: The models represent the data that your application will store in the database.
Views: The views are responsible for processing HTTP requests and returning responses.
Templates: The templates are used to render the HTML pages that are displayed to users.
URLs: The URLs map HTTP requests to views.
The workflow of a Django application is as follows:

A user makes an HTTP request to the application.
The Django framework matches the request to a URL.
The Django framework calls the corresponding view.
The view retrieves the data from the database (using the models).
The view renders a template (using the templates).
The Django framework returns the rendered template to the user.


The components of a Django application interact with each other to create a functional web application. The models provide the data that the views need to process requests. The views use the templates to render the HTML pages that are displayed to users. The URLs map HTTP requests to views.
