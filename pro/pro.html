            What's the main purpose of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and how do they work?

            JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a secure way of sharing information between two parties. They are compact and self-contained, transmitted as JSON objects. These tokens can be trusted because they are digitally signed.
            
            JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization. When a user logs in, the server creates a JWT containing the user's identity and permissions. The user sends this JWT in subsequent requests to access resources, and the server verifies it to authenticate and authorize the user.
            
            How does JWT Authentication work with Django REST Framework to secure API endpoints, and what are the key components involved?
            
            Django REST Framework (DRF) uses JWT authentication to secure API endpoints. The important components involved in this process are:
            
            The JWTAuthentication class: It verifies JWT tokens.
            The JWTSerializer class: It handles serialization and deserialization of JWT tokens.
            The settings.py file: Contains configuration settings for JWT authentication.
            To use JWT authentication with DRF, follow these steps:
            
            Install the djangorestframework-simplejwt package.
            Add the JWTAuthentication class to the REST_FRAMEWORK settings.
            Use the JWTSerializer class to handle JWT tokens.
            Why is Django's built-in runserver not suitable for production environments, and what are some alternative server options?
            
            Django's built-in runserver is not suitable for production environments because it isn't designed to handle high traffic or distributed setups. It's more suitable for development purposes. Some alternative server options for deploying a Django application are:
            
            Gunicorn: A high-performance Python WSGI server known for its scalability.
            Nginx: A popular web server that can proxy requests to Gunicorn or other WSGI servers.
            Docker: A containerization platform that ensures consistent and portable deployment of Django applica
