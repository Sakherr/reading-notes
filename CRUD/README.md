Django Forms are a powerful way to handle user input in Django applications. They provide a means to validate user input, collect data from users, and display error messages.

Key components of creating a form using the Django framework include:

The form class: This class defines the form, specifying the fields and validation rules for those fields.
The form template: This template renders the form, including the HTML code and logic for displaying error messages.
The form data: This data is submitted by the user and is stored in the request object.
Django Forms offer convenient features, such as automatic form validation and error message display, making them user-friendly and efficient.

Django Templates are used to render HTML pages in Django applications, separating the presentation layer from the business logic layer.

Template inheritance, a feature of Django Templates, enables code reuse between templates, enhancing code reusability and maintainability.

For instance, a base template with common HTML code can be created, and child templates can inherit from it, specifying only page-specific HTML code. This reduces code duplication and simplifies code maintenance.

Django Views handle HTTP requests in Django applications, acting as the connection between templates and models (business logic).

There are two types of views in Django: function-based views and class-based views.

Function-based views are simple functions that take a request object and return a response object.

Class-based views, on the other hand, are more sophisticated. They are classes that inherit from the View class, offering additional features like automatic form validation, error handling, and permissions checking. Class-based views are more reusable and maintainable, whereas function-based views are easier to understand and implement.
