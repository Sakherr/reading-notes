# Classes and objects in Python:

## In Python, classes define the blueprint for objects, while objects are instances of a class.
## A class is a template that defines attributes and methods, while an object is a specific instance of that class.
## Objects are created from a class definition and have their own unique state and behavior.
## To create a class in Python, you define it using the "class" keyword, while to create an object, you call the class with parentheses.
## Classes and objects enable object-oriented programming in Python, which allows for more modular and reusable code.

### Example:
``` 
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
``` 
# Recursion in Python:

## Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself, either directly or indirectly, to solve a problem.
## Recursive functions can have one or more base cases that terminate the recursion, as well as one or more recursive cases that call the function with modified arguments.
## Recursion is useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems that are similar in nature to the original problem.
## A classic example of recursion is computing the factorial of a number.
## Best practices for implementing recursive functions include defining a base case, making sure the input to the recursive case is modified towards the base case, and keeping track of the recursion depth.

## Example: Computing the factorial of a number using recursion.

``` 
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
        
print(factorial(5)) 
``` 
# Pytest fixtures and code coverage:

## Pytest fixtures are functions that  set up preconditions for testing and clean up afterwards, providing a consistent environment for test cases.
## Code coverage is a measure of how much of the codebase is executed during testing, which can help identify areas that need more testing.
## Pytest fixtures can be used to improve code coverage by providing more opportunities to execute code paths that might otherwise be missed.
## Code coverage can be measured using tools like coverage or pytest-cov, which report on the percentage of lines or branches that were executed during testing.
## By using fixtures to set up test data and environment conditions, and measuring code coverage during testing, developers can ensure that their code is more thoroughly tested and maintainable over time.
