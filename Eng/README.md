## Act like you make $1000/hr.

### "People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable." - William Irvine.

### Respecting both yourself and your time is crucial to your well-being. Failure to do so can result in feelings of unhappiness, bitterness, and fatigue. To achieve mastery and independence, it is imperative that you hold your time in high regard and not allow it to be easily taken for granted.

## How to think like a programmer.

### To think like a programmer means how to solve a problem, which involves understanding the problem, planning a solution, breaking the problem into sub-problems, and expanding the solution until you reach the original problem.

 

## The 5 Whys

### I can use the 5 whys model by follow this step :

#### 1. Assemble a Team

#### 2.Define the Problem

#### 3.Ask the First "Why?"

#### 4.Ask "Why?" Four More Times

#### 5.Know When to Stop

#### 6.Address the Root Cause(s)

#### 7.Monitor Your Measures

## Solving Problems.

### I should follow these steps for any algorithmic programming problem:

### Read the problem statement twice, making sure you understand it fully.
### Manually solve the problem using three different sets of sample data.
### Refine the manual steps to make them more efficient.
### Document the manual steps by writing them as comments or pseudo-code.
# Engineering Readings

### Translate the comments or pseudo-code into actual code.
### Optimize the code for improved performance.

### Logical thinking and breaking the big problem into sub-problems.

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on a tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

### Pause and reflect: Occasionally, stepping away from the problem can allow me to reexamine it from a new viewpoint. Take a brief pause, engage in physical activity or perform some other task for a short time. When I return to the issue, I may have a rejuvenated outlook and a more unclouded mindset.

### Deconstruct the problem: In some cases, a convoluted issue can be overwhelming, leaving me uncertain of how to proceed. Consider dividing the problem into smaller, more manageable components. This approach can alleviate the difficulty of the problem and enable me to concentrate on individual aspects of it.

### Engage in teamwork: When I find myself stuck on a difficult problem, I don't hesitate to reach out to my colleagues or mentors for their input. They might have faced similar problems in the past and could provide me with valuable suggestions and insights. Working with them can also help me broaden my skill set and acquire new techniques that will come in handy later on.
