## Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh are Python libraries used for data visualization. They all have different features and purposes.

## Matplotlib is the oldest and most comprehensive library. It offers various plot types like line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms. You can customize your plots in great detail with Matplotlib.

## Seaborn is a newer library that builds on Matplotlib. It provides high-level functions for creating attractive and informative statistical plots. It's great for showing relationships between variables, like correlation plots and regression plots.

## Bokeh is another newer library designed for interactive visualizations. You can embed Bokeh plots in web pages and interact with the data in different ways. It's perfect for creating dashboards and interactive visualizations.

 # examples of visualizations suited for each library:

## Matplotlib: A line plot showing the stock price of a company over time.
## Seaborn: A correlation plot showing the relationship between two variables.
## Bokeh: An interactive dashboard displaying survey results.

# Seaborn has main functions for creating relational, categorical, and distribution plots.

## Relational plots: Show the relationship between variables, like scatter plots, line plots, and bar charts.
## Categorical plots: Display data distribution into categories, such as boxplots, violin plots, and bar charts.
## Distribution plots: Visualize data distribution using histograms, kernel density plots, and rug plots.

## Each plot type has its own purpose. For example, scatter plots show the relationship between continuous variables, while boxplots illustrate data distribution into categories.

## The Seaborn Cheat Sheet is a useful resource for Python developers learning Seaborn. It provides an overview of the library's features, including the main functions for creating different types of plots. The cheat sheet also offers examples to help you create various visualizations.

## The cheat sheet covers plot types, parameters for customization, and includes examples to guide your visualization creation. It's a handy reference for Seaborn functionalities, allowing you to quickly explore and develop your skills.
